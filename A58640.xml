         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet, ſuch was the prevalency of the ſpirit of Rebellion that raged in many for the time, that not content of that peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which even above their deſires, was ſecured to them; nor of thoſe many Grants of honour and profit, by which, His

                  <p>The ſaids Commiſſioners ſhall put His

And if any perſon refuſe to concur for mending of High-wayes and Paſſages, the ſaids Juſtices ſhall have power to cenſure and puniſh them according to their diſcretion; with proviſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that if in their proceedings therein, they uſe ſuch ſeverity or rigour as may move juſt complaints againſt them, they ſhall be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured therefore by His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Secret Council as appertaineth.</p>
                  <p>The ſaids Juſtices ſhall put His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Acts of Parliament to execution, againſt Cutters and Deſtroyers of Plantting, Green-wood, Orchards, Gardens, Haynings, Breakers of Dove-houſes and Cunninghares, Stealers of Bees and Bee-hives, uſers of unlawfull Games with Setting Doggs, Slayers of red and black Fiſhes and Smolts, in forbidden time, Foulers fouling in other mens Lands, Makers of Moorburn and Moſſeburn, Setters of Crooes and Nets in Waters and Dames, having, and keeping of Crooes and Yairs in forbidden time, and ſhall proceed againſt them accordingly. And for their better war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47571:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>to proceed in the premiſſes, it is His Highneſſe pleaſure, that Commiſſions be granted to the ſaids Juſtices of Peace, to try and puniſh the violators of the ſaids Acts; in the tryal whereof they ſhall proceed by witneſſes, or by oath of Party; and the puniſhment to be inflicted by them, ſhall be a pecunial ſum, anſwerable to the circumſtance of the offence, and quality of the offenders; with ſpecial proviſion, that their Cenſures and Puniſhments ſhall extend againſt none, but thoſe againſt whom by priviledge of their Inſtructions they may lawfully proceed. And alſo with proviſion, that the ſaids Commiſſions be not extended to any perſons, who ſhall be arreſted and conveened for the ſaids crimes, before any other ordinary Judge. It is alſo provided, that the ordinance and power contained in this Article, ſhall no wayes be prejudicial to any other Commiſſions, or Rights whatſoever, granted to other parties, whereby they have power to proceed and cenſure the crimes and offences above-written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> They ſhall inform the Kings
<hi>Majeſties</hi> Council, and His Highneſſe Treaſurer, or Advocat, at the leaſt once every year, of Forſtallers and Regraters of Mercats, that order may be taken with them, conform to the Acts of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>It ſhall not be leaſome to any Hoaſtlar, to reſſet any Maſterleſſe Men and Rebels at the Horn, any Vagabonds, or other perſons guilty of known crimes, or uſing Stouth and Reaf, under the pains under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written: To wit, fourty ſhillings, to be incurred by them for the firſt fault, four pounds for the ſecond, and ten merks for the third; together with the loſing of the liberty of Brewing: The incurrers of the which pains, ſhall be puniſhed according to the order foreſaid, by the Barrons and Maſters of the ground whereupon the Hoaſtlar dwelleth, within the ſpace of fifteen dayes after the committing of the Fact; and if the ſaids Barrons and Heritors, neglect to do the ſame, within the ſaid ſpace, it ſhall be lawfull to the ſaids Juſtices, to purſue and fine the Delinquents in their Courts, according to the pains foreſaid, and to uplift the ſame from them; without prejudice alwayes of whatſoever Acts, made againſt the ſaids Hoaſtlars in the Barron Court Books, under whom they dwell, bearing any higher pain, then as is ſet down in this above-written Act; and alſo without prejudice of all Action, Criminal or Civil, competent of the Law, againſt the ſaids Hoaſtlars, in caſe they be under the danger thereof, which ſhall not be taken away by any puniſhment, ſet down, and to be inflicted conform to this Act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> They ſhall inform the Kings Treaſurer and Advocat, of breakers and contraveeners of the Acts of Parliament, made againſt Malt-makers, that the tranſgreſſors and contraveeners thereof may be puniſhed, conform to the Tenor of the ſaids Acts.</p>
                  <p>They ſhall ſet down order in the Countrey, for Governance in time of Plague, and ſhall puniſh ſeverely the diſobeyers of the order appointed by them, according to the quality of the Delinquent.</p>
                  <p>They ſhall appoint at the Quarter Seſſions to be kept in

                  <p>The ſaids Juſtices ſhall take notice in all Sheriffdoms, where there are any Goales, and Priſon-houſes, within any Burgh, that the ſame may be kept up and not ſuffered to decay or become ruinous: and if there be any Shire, where there is not any Goal or Priſon-houſe, they ſhall inform His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Council thereof, that they may appoint and give order for building of one within the Head Burgh of the Shire, and according to the directions to be given thereanent, the Juſtices ſhall be holden to proceed.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe there be a great many of Priſoners apprehended and committed, who having no means of their own for their maintenance and entertainment, will otherwayes famiſh and ſtarve before they can come to their tryal, who not the leſſe, in regard of the crimes committed, can no wayes be put under ſurety, or otherwayes, in faults of leſſe conſequence, are unable to find ſufficient Caution to be made forth coming, and anſwerable at the next Seſſion; Therefore it ſhall be lawfull to the ſaids Commiſſioners and Juſtices, at their Quarter Seſſion, to rate every Paroch for a weekly proportion, for the entertainment of thoſe poor Priſoners; providing they do not exceed the ſum of five ſhillings
<hi>Scots</hi> money at the moſt, nor under one ſhilling at the leaſt; which ſum ſhall be uplifted for that uſe by the Miniſter or Reader, who ſhall ſerve at every Paroch, from ſuch Deacons, who ſhall be appointed to collect the ſame; and the ſaids ſums to be delivered by the Conſtable of the Paroch, at the Quarter Seſſions, in preſence of the whole Bench then conveened, to ſuch perſons as the ſaids Juſtices ſhall truſt therewith, and who accordingly, ſhall make due account in paying the Jaylors ſuch rates as ſhall be allowed for the poor Priſoners, and making the reſt forth coming for ſuch uſe and intent of the like nature, as the ſaids Juſtices ſhall appoint.</p>
                  <p>All Magiſtrates of Burghs, and keepers of any Goals or Priſons, ſhall receive into their Priſons, all ſuch perſons, as either ſhall be brought by Conſtables, or ſent unto them by Warrands under the hand of any one Juſtice of Peace, the ſaids Juſtices cauſing ſatisfie for their entertainment; and if any Magiſtrates, or their Jaylors, ſuffer any perſons, committed by the Juſtices to their Priſons, to eſcape, they ſhall be condignly puniſhed therefore, at the diſcretion of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Council.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> Our Soveraign Lord, with advice foreſaid, Ordains the ſaids Commiſſioners, to ſet a price upon Crafts-mens work, and upon the Ordinars of Penny-Bridals, together with the price of Shearers Fees, and to puniſh the Contraveeners, as appertaineth.</p>
                  <p>They ſhall cauſe ſufficient ſingle and double Ale to be brewed in every Shire, and ſhall appoint Viſitors to that effect, with conſent of the

                  <p>Our Soveraign Lord, with advice foreſaid, Declareth, That Three Juſtices of Peace ſhall be a full number and Seſſion, to decide in matters occurring betwixt the four Quarter Seſſions.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Declares, that no Letters of Caption ought to be granted againſt the ſaids Juſtices, for apprehending of Rebels, except they be found ſubject to do the ſame, by poſſeſſing of ſuch other offices and places, to the which the obedience and putting to execution of any ſuch charges doth belong.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe there is ſenſible prejudice ſeen and felt through many parts of the Kingdom, by reaſon of diverſity of Meaſures and Weights uſed in the ſame. Therefore Our Soveraign Lord, with advice foreſaid, for removing of all abuſes which may enſue in any time to come thereby, Hath found expedient, and by this Decreet and Statute of Parliament, Decerns, Statutes and Ordains, That there ſhall be but one juſt Meaſure and Weight through all the parts of the Kingdom, which ſhall univerſally ſerve all His Highneſſe Lieges, by the which they ſhall ſell and buy, and receive, and give out in all times to come; which Meaſure, His
<hi>Majeſty</hi> with advice foreſaid, finds ſhould be that Meaſure of
<hi>Linlithgow,</hi> which is now commonly uſed and which hath been uſed moſt cuſtomably through the greateſt parts of this Kingdom theſe many years by-paſt. And for ſetling a perfit Order, whereby all the Meaſures that are now uſed may be reduced to the conformity of the ſaids Meaſures now authorized; and for making of proportion anſwerable betwixt the leſſer Meaſure and Weights, and the greateſt. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> with advice foreſaid, hath granted full power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to
<hi>Alexander Frazer</hi> of <hi>Phillorth,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Ramſay</hi> of <hi>Balmayn, William Scot</hi> of <hi>Ardroſs, John Murray</hi> of

And that there may be one conſtant conformity in Head Burgh and Land, Our Soveraign Lord, with advice and conſent foreſaid, Ordains, that the ſaids Juſtices of Peace, in Landwart, take tryal of the Meaſures and Weights uſed in Burgh, and to take a Note from the Magiſtrates, and Deans of Gild of every

                  <p>The ſaids Juſtices ſhall be holden to give command and direction to their Conſtables, to apprehend any ſuch perſon, who ſhall be found contemptuouſly to have diſobeyed the Cenſures of the Church, they being lawfully required to do the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The ſaids Juſtices of Peace, as well to Burgh as Land, ſhall conveen and be preſent at the Quarter Seſſions of the Shire where the Burgh and Land lyeth, give their Oath to the Bench at their admiſſion, make their Record, and make paiment of the Fines intrometted with by them, as Juſtices of Peace of that Shire, to their Collector.</p>
                  <p>They ſhall appoint a ſufficient Collector for uplifting the Fines and Penalties, which they have power to impoſe upon an Offender, and are to take Caution of him for making due accompt.</p>
                  <p>They ſhall have, during the time of Seſſions, for every day of their abode (ſo it do not exceed the number of three dayes at the moſt at one time) allowed to every one of them, fourty ſhillings

                  <p>The Lords of Seſſion ſhall direct general and ſummar Charges of Horning and Poynding, at the inſtance of the Collector appointed in every Countrey for ingathering all Fines and Penalties whatſoever incurred, upon a ſimple Charge of fifteen dayes; and no Suſpenſion ſhall be granted thereof, but upon conſignation of the ſums contained in the Sentences, and by finding Caution for paiment of the charges, at the modification of the ſaids Lords.</p>
                  <p>The ſaids Commiſſioners, at the end of every Quarter Seſſion, ſhall

And albeit that all the Acts of the pretended Parliaments, in the years one thouſand ſix hundred and fourty, and one thouſand ſix hundred fourty and one, and ſince; are Declared by an Act of this preſent Parliament, null and of none avail in all time coming; Yet it is hereby Declared, That all and whatſoever Valuations, Acts, Sentences and Decreets, done, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and decerned by vertue of any Commiſſions granted by the ſaids pretended Parliaments, with all execution uſed or to be uſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, are and ſhall ſtand valid in all time coming, notwithſtanding of the foreſaid Act Reſciſſory; And this for the good and eaſe of the People, and for incouragement of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, whereunto His

As alſo, with Power to the ſaids Commiſſioners, upon the dependance of the ſaids Complaints and Proceſſes to diſcharge execution upon the foreſaids Decreets, in whole or in part, as they ſhall find juſt, ay and while the matter be determined by them. As alſo in reſpect that by diverſe Decreets pronounced by the ſaids Commiſſioners appointed by the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in
<hi>Anno</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and fourty nine, the burden of an Augmentation was put upon diverſe Tackſ-men of Teinds, and yet no recompence was made to them by proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſaids Tacks; In regard alſo that diverſe Regiſters of Commiſſions, preceeding the Year one thouſand ſix hundred and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47571:57"/>fourty nine, are loſt, whereby Prorogations were granted in favours of Tackſ-men, and the Extracts alſo periſhed the time of the Troubles: Therefore His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with conſent foreſaid, Gives power to the ſaids Commiſſioners, or
<hi>Quorum</hi> foreſaid, appointed by this Commiſſion, to grant recompence and prorogation to the ſaids Tackſ-men, in the ſame manner as was preſcribed by the former Commiſſions, namely by the Commiſſion in
<hi>Anno</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and ſeventeen, the Titulars alwayes being cited thereto. And whereas it may fall out, that ſome of the ſaids Commiſſioners now appointed, may be unable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſervice, through death, ſickneſs, or ſome other notour and known impediment. Therefore His <hi>Majeſty</hi> Declareth, that He ſhall be carefull to fill their places with other perſons qualified, whoſe Oaths for faithfull diſcharge of the ſame, ſhall be taken by the Lord Chancellor, or in his abſence, by the Preſident of the ſaid Commiſſion for the time: And Ordains this preſent Commiſſion to endure ay and while the ſame be diſcharged by His <hi>Majeſty;</hi> and Ordains the Acts, Decreets and Ordinances thereof, to have the force, ſtrength and effect of a Decreet, Sentence and Act of Parliament; and the Lords of the Seſſion to grant and direct Letters of Horning, Poinding and others requiſit, in manner contained in the foreſaids former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. And conſidering that it was the will and pleaſure of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Royal Father, that all Heritors who ſhould be willing to buy, ſhould have their own Teinds at reaſonable Rates; Therefore His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with advice foreſaid, Statutes and Ordains, that all Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors whoſe Teinds are not valued, ſhall have liberty to value and buy the ſame at ſuch Rates as are contained in the Act of Parliament one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty three years. With power to augment the ſaids Rates according to the burden of Augmentations and others ſuſtained by the Titulars, ſince the ſaid Act of Parliament one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty three years; and the ſaids He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors to have the liberty of buying, as ſaid is, within the ſpace of three years after the valuation. With power to the ſaids Commiſſioners to determine therein according to Juſtice; with this Declaration alwayes, That in caſe the impediment during the ſpace foreſaid, flow from the Titular, by reaſon of his minority or other inability, in that caſe, the Heritor who offered himſelf ready to buy his own Teind within the ſpace foreſaid, ſhall have place, ſo ſoon as the impediment is removed, to buy his Teinds, notwithſtanding of the expiring of the years and ſpace above-expreſt. And it is Declared, that if the Heritor be Minor, and his Tutors neglect the buying of his Teinds within the foreſaid ſpace, the Minor ſhall have Action for two years after his minority, to compell the Titular for ſelling of the ſaids Teinds.</p>

Therefore His
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> with advice and conſent of the Eſtates of Parliament, Statutes and Ordains, That for all Sums and Debts contracted before the tearm of Whitſunday, one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty eight years, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one thouſand pounds <hi>Scots</hi> of principal, perſonal execution ſhall be forborne by the ſpace of ſix years, to begin at Whitſunday laſt by-paſt, in this inſtant year, one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty one; Providing that the Debitors make paiment of one years Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent at Candlemeſſe next, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty two, and that the reſidue of the by-gone Annualrents of the ſaid Sums, reſting unpaid at Whitſunday next, ſhall become and be made a principal Sum, and the Debitor ſhall give ſecurity for the ſame to theſe who have right to the by-gone Annualrents, when they take the benefit of the foreſaid forbearance, in manner after-mentioned; or at any other time that the ſame ſhall be demanded: Which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to be granted for the ſaid by-gone Annualrents, made up in a principal Sum, ſhall bear obliegement to pay Annualrent for the ſame, in manner and from the tearms after-ſpecified, <hi>viz.</hi> For a third part thereof, from Whitſunday next, one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty two years; and for an other third part, from Martimeſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in the ſaid year; and for the laſt third part, from Whitſunday, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty three, during the not paiment of the ſaid principal Sum ſo made up, for which, perſonal execution is to be forborne, as for the other principal Sums, by the ſpace aforeſaid of ſix years after Whitſunday laſt. And without prejudice of the Security to be granted in manner foreſaid, It is alſo Declared and Ordained, that the ſaid by-gone Annualrents, are made

               <p>And notwithſtanding of the Premiſſes, It is hereby Declared, that the Lords of Seſſion ſhall have power to grant and paſſe Suſpenſions for Sums not exceeding one thouſand pounds, upon ſuch reaſons as they ſhall think juſt.</p>
               <p>And where thoſe who have right to by-gone Annualrents are only Liferenters, and have no right to the ſtock and principall Sum, It is Ordained, that it ſhall be lawfull to them to uſe execution for the whole by-gone Annualrents due to them, as they might have done before the making of theſe Preſents; and that the ſaids Lords of Seſſion ſhall have power to grant and paſſe Suſpenſions againſt the ſaids Liferenters, in caſe they ſhall find juſt grounds and cauſe for granting of the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is likewayes Provided, that the benefit of the ſaid forbearance, ſhall only be granted and competent to ſuch Debitors, as ſhall pay the ſaid years Annualrent, within the time foreſaid, and ſhall betwixt and the firſt day of <hi>November,</hi> compear before any of the Lords of Seſſion, with the Clerk, and declare before them upon Oath, that their Debts exceeds the value of four years Rent of their Eſtate, pertaining to, and poſſeſt by, them: which Declaration, extracted under the hand of the Clerk of Regiſter, or his Deputies, ſhall be a ſufficient Security againſt Perſonall execution: And for which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, the Clerk Regiſter and his Deputies ſhall have for their Fees the ſum of thirty three ſhillings four pennies <hi>Scots,</hi> and no more; And it is Declared, that all perſons, who ſhall not by themſelves, or their Tutors or Curators, appear and declare within the time, and in manner foreſaid, ſhall be excluded from the benefit of the foreſaid forbearance, and ſhall never be reponed or admitted thereafter, upon any pretext whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And the benefit of the foreſaid forbearance being granted to the Debitors, or any of their Cautioners, upon the compearance and declaration foreſaid, ſhall only be perſonall for them and their Heirs and others repreſenting them, and ſhall not be extended to thoſe who are bound with them, and lyable to the ſaids Debts, unleſſe they alſo compear and declare, that their own proper Debts and Cautionry for perſons who have taken the benefit of this Act, exceeds the value of four years Rent of their Eſtate, and that within the time and in manner foreſaid.</p>
               <p>And for the more eaſe of the Debitors, It is Ordained, that in caſe within the time of the forbearance foreſaid, the Debitor ſhall offer to the Creditor a part of his Debt, not being beneath or within the third part of the whole Sums due by him to the Creditor for the time, the Creditor in that caſe, ſhall be holden to accept of the ſaid partiall

               <p>And whereas the legall reverſion of Compriſings was formerly limited to ſeven years, His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> for the reaſons and with conſent foreſaid, is graciouſly pleaſed to extend the ſame to ten years in all time coming; and Statutes and Ordains, that all Compriſings already deduced, and whereof the legall reverſion is not yet expired, or which ſhall be deduced any time hereafter, ſhall be redeemable within the ſpace of ten years after the date of the ſame; and all Compriſings deduced ſince <hi>January,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty two years, and whereof the legalls are expired, and all Compriſings deduced before the ſaid moneth of <hi>January,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty two years, and which were not expired before the ſaid moneth of

               <p>And in caſe the Lands and others compriſed, exceed in yearly Rent and value, the Annualrent of the Sums contained in the ſaids Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſings, and of the expence disburſed in obtaining Infeſtments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and the Debitor ſhall deſire the Creditor to poſſeſſe the Lands and others compriſed, it ſhall be lawfull to the Lords of Seſſion, likeas the ſaids Lords are hereby impowered and authorized, upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to be made to them by the Debitor, and Citation of the Compriſers, to appoint the Appriſers to poſſeſſe ſuch of the ſaids Lands and others, during the legall reverſion, as the ſaids Lords of Seſſion ſhall think juſt and reaſonable; the ſaids Debitors alwayes giving poſſeſſion to thoſe who have right to the ſaids Compriſings, and ratifying their poſſeſſion already apprehended by them (if any ſuch poſſeſſion they have) of ſuch of the ſaids Lands and others as the ſaids Lords of the Seſſion ſhall appoint, not being beneath in yearly Rent and value of the Annualrents above-mentioned; or otherwayes giving to the Creditors (whether they have poſſeſſion or not) ſufficient ſecurity, at the ſight of the ſaids Lords, for paiment of the ſaids Annualrents, during the time foreſaid; the ſaids Lords of Seſſion having alwayes power to determine, whether in the caſes foreſaids, the Debitor ſhall give Surety to the Creditor for his Annualrents, or the Debitor not being able to give Surety, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor ſhall be oblieged to take poſſeſſion of the Debitors Lands. And if the Lords of Seſſion ſhall appoint, in the caſe foreſaid, the Creditor to be poſſeſt for his Annualrent, then, and in that caſe, the Debitor ſhall be holden to deliver the Evidents of the ſaids Lands to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, or tranſumps thereof; providing alwayes, that the Creditors right, by vertue of the ſaids Compriſings, be no wayes prejudged after the expiring of the ſame: And that the whole Lands and others,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47571:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>both ſuch as ſhall be poſſeſſed by the Debitor, and the remanent of of the Lands and others contained in the ſaids Compriſings, ſhall pertain to the Creditor irredeemably.</p>
               <p>And becauſe oftentimes Creditors, in regard they live at diſtance, or upon other occaſions, are prejudged and preveened, by the more timeous diligence of other Creditors, ſo that before they can know the condition of the common Debitor, his Eſtate is compriſed, and the poſterior Compriſers have only right to the legal reverſion, which may, and doth often prove ineffectual to them, not being able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and redeem the prior Compriſings (their means and money being in the hands of the common Debitor) Therefore it is Statute and Ordained, That all Compriſings, deduced ſince the firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty two years, before the firſt effectual Compriſing, or after, but within year and day of the ſame, ſhall come in <hi>pari paſſu</hi> together, as if one Compriſing had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and obtained for the whole reſpective Sums, contained in the foreſaids Compriſings. And it is Declared, that ſuch Compriſings as are preferable to all others in reſpect of the firſt real Right and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment following thereupon, or the firſt exact diligence for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, are and ſhall be holden the firſt effectual Compriſing, though there be others in date before and anterior to the ſame; and the foreſaid benefit given and introduced hereby, in favours of theſe whoſe Compriſings are led within the time, and in manner foreſaid, is only granted and competent in the caſe of Compriſings, led ſince the firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty two years, and to be led after the date of thir preſents, and for perſonal Debt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without prejudice alwayes of ground Annuals, Annualrents due upon Infeftment, and other real Debts, and
<hi>Debita fundi,</hi> and of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſings therefore of Lands and others affected therewith, which ſhall be effectual and preferable according to the Laws and Practick of this Kingdom now ſtanding; And it is alſo provided, that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, having right to the firſt Compriſing, except as is above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ſhall be ſatisfied by the poſterior Compriſers, claiming the benefit foreſaid, of the whole expence disburſed by them, in deducing and expeding the ſaid firſt Compriſing and Infeftments thereupon.</p>
               <p>And further, for obviating the frequent and fraudfull practice of the appearand Heirs of Debitors, who are in uſe to acquire the right of expired Compriſings, and by vertue thereof, to enjoy and poſſeſs their Predeceſſors Lands and Eſtate, to the prejudice and defrauding of the poſterior Compriſings and other Creditors, It is Statute, that in caſe the appearand Heir of any Debitor, or any other confident perſon to his behoof, ſhall at any time hereafter acquire the right of an expired Compriſing, already deduced, or which ſhall be led and deduced hereafter, the ſaid right ſhall be redeemable from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearand Heir, or the ſaid confident perſon, their Heirs and Succeſſors, within the ſpace of ten years, after the acquiring of the ſaid right, by the poſterior Compriſers, upon paiment allanerly of the Sums truly paid and given out, for buying and acquiring the ſaids rights, at the

               <p>And His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with conſent foreſaid, doth Declare, That the benefit foreſaid introduced hereby anent Compriſings, ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Adjudications for Debt; ſo that the Creditors, at whoſe inſtance the ſame are obtained, and thoſe who have right to redeem the ſame, ſhall be in the ſame caſe as to the benefit foreſaid, as if the ſaid Adjudications for Debts were Compriſings.</p>
               <p>And in caſe a Creditor, againſt whom the benefit of the foreſaid forbearance for ſix years ſhall be taken, or who hath led, or ſhall lead a Compriſing againſt the Debitor, ſhall think fit, and be willing, and deſirous to take his Debitors Lands, or other Eſtate, or any part thereof for ſecurity or paiment, and in ſatisfaction of his Debt, then, and in either of theſe caſes, the Debitor ſhall be holden to give Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity out of his Lands, and other Eſtate, or to ſell the ſame to the Creditor, at the ſight of the Lords of Seſſion, with ſuch warrandize, and at ſuch rates and prices (if the Creditor be content to buy) as they ſhall appoint; with certification, that otherwayes the Debitor, refuſing or failing, ſhall loſe and forfeit all benefit introduced in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Debitors by this preſent Act, as if it had never been made.</p>
               <p>And in regard ſome perſons may have taken advantage of the late times and troubles, by taking and acquiring of proper Wodſets of Lands and others, exceeding the Annualrent of the Sums lent upon the ſame; and providing nevertheleſſe, by the right of the foreſaids Wodſets, and expreſſe proviſions therein, or by writ a part, that they ſhould not be lyable to any hazard of the Fruits, Tennents, War or Troubles; His
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> with conſent foreſaid, Statutes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains, that all ſuch Wodſets, granted ſince the year one thouſand ſix hundred and fourty nine, ſhall be reſtricted to the ordinary Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Sums whereupon the ſame are redeemable; and the ſaids Wodſetters ſhall be countable for the <hi>ſuperplus</hi> of the Mails and Duties, and other benefit of the ſame, exceeding the Annualrent of the ſaids Sums, and the ſame ſhall be imputed and aſcribed, in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the ſaid principall Sums <hi>pro tanto:</hi> And in caſe any ſuch Bargains and Rights ſhall be made and acquired hereafter, His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with conſent foreſaid, Declares the ſame unlawfull and uſurary, and the Contraveeners ſhall be puniſhed ſeverely as Uſurers, conform to the Laws and Acts of Parliament againſt Ockerers and Uſurers.</p>
               <p>And as to proper Wodſets, granted ſince the time foreſaid, where the Creditor undergoes the ſaids hazards, and the ſame are affected with the ordinar proviſions and clauſes irritant, in caſe of not paiment of the Sums given out and due upon the ſaids Wodſets, at the tearmes and in manner mentioned in the ſaids Rights: albeit the ſaids Wodſets and Proviſions be lawfull; yet His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> conſidering and having reſpect to the difficulties of the times, Statutes and Ordains, with conſent foreſaid, That the ſaids Clauſes irritant, ſhall not take away the Heritors right, they alwayes redeeming within the ſpace of five years after Whitſunday laſt: And in caſe the Debitors conceive, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47571:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>they have diſ-advantage by the ſaid proper Wodſets, and ſhall deſire to redeem the ſame, it ſhall be lawfull to them to redeem at any tearm of Whitſunday or Martimeſſe they pleaſe, notwithſtanding of any proviſion to the contrair in the ſaid Wodſet-rights, or any other right a part ſuſpending the redemption thereof. Likeas it is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That the Clauſes of requiſition contained in proper Wodſets, granted ſince the year one thouſand ſix hundred fourty nine years, ſhall be effectual and no wayes ſuſpended nor prejudged hereby; But prejudice alwayes to the forbearance of perſonal execution in manner above-written. And where the Creditors and Wodſetters have tranſacted with their Debitors, and have acquired irredeemable rights, for, and in place of, their former Wodſets, It is Ordained and Declared, That when, and at what time ſoever the ſaids Wodſets were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether before or ſince the year one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty years, the ſaids tranſactions and irredeemable rights acquired by the Creditor for the ſame, are and ſhall be valid and effectual, and ſhall no wayes be prejudged by theſe preſents.</p>
               <p>And further, His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with conſent foreſaid, doth Declare, That in caſe any Debitors have by voluntar agreement betwixt them and their Creditors, or any of them renounced the benefit of any Acts of this nature, concerning Debitor and Creditor, made or to be made, the ſaid agreement ſhall be of force and effectual, and ſhall not be prejudged hereby; without prejudice alwayes to the ſaid Debitor of the prorogation foreſaid of the legal reverſions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſings led and deduced againſt them, and not as yet expired, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of the agreement and renounciation foreſaid.</p>
               <p>And becauſe, before the year one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty, when money paſt at eight or ten <hi>per cent.</hi> divers proper Wodſets were then made and granted, and are yet unredeemed; and ſince the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty, there be divers perſons, who taking advantage of the times, refuſed to lend their money, unleſs they got proper Wodſets of Lands and Teinds, at extraordinary advantages, to the heavy prejudice of the Debitors: Therefore, His
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> with advice foreſaid, Statutes and Ordains, That in time coming, during the not requiſition of the Sums where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſaids Wodſets are redeemable, and during the not redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame reſpectively, if the Debitors ſhall give ſufficient Security to the Wodſetter for paiment of his Annualrent, during the not redemption, or not requiſition, as ſaid is; In that caſe, the Creditor-wodſetter, ſhall be holden to renounce and quit his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſaids Lands and Teinds, in favours of the Debitor and others having right from him; At leaſt if the Wodſetter ſhall be content to retain the poſſeſſion of the ſame; In that caſe all the free Profits and Rents, which he ſhall have or uplift out of the ſaids Lands, ſhall be reſtricted to ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> yearly of free money, and the Wodſetter ſhall be countable to the Debitor, or others having right from him, for the <hi>ſuperplus;</hi> and that without prejudice of the Wodſetters real Right and Infeftment, ay and while the Lands be redeemed, and the principall Sum whereupon the ſame is redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47571:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall be ſatisfied. It is alwayes provided, that where any Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath had loſſe by his poſſeſſion of the Wodſet-lands and others ſince the date of his Wodſet, So that he hath not received as much free Rent as, <hi>communibus annis,</hi> hath extended to the Annualrent allowed by Law for the time, all charges and burdens being deduced; in that caſe, it is provided that the Wodſetter ſhall be firſt ſatisfied of what he wants before he quit his poſſeſſion of the ſaid Wodſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, or be holden to accept Security for his Annualrents: And it is Declared, that in the account of the Wodſetter's by-gone loſſe, there ſhall be allowed what he hath disburſed upon reparation and building of Tennents houſes, Milnes, and for the advantage of the ground; and generally all other expence which the Wodſetter was put to, and what loſſe he ſuſtained in reference to the ſaid Wodſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Rights and Securities thereof, any manner of way; and what he hath loſt by Quarterings, Ceſſe, waſte Land, depauperated Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, or by Tennents who were or are not able to pay, unleſſe the ground ſhould be caſten waſte: And becauſe the Wodſetters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his ſaids loſſe may be difficile, he not conceiving that there ſhould be neceſſity for any ſuch count, or that there ſhould be any alteration made in the right and poſſeſſion of his proper Wodſet, Therefore His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with advice foreſaid, doth allow the Lords of Seſſion to take ſuch reaſonable probation as in equity they ſhall think fit: And if there be any deficiency, to take the Wodſetters Oath in ſupplement; and where the Wodſetter is in natural poſſeſſion of the Wodſet-lands, by dwelling thereon or labouring the ſame with his own Plough and Goods, or otherwayes, having the ſame pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with his ſaids Goods, in that caſe, he ſhall not be holden to remove from his ſaid poſſeſſion, but at the ordinary tearm of removing, and that he be lawfully warned fourty dayes before, and after ſufficient Security ſhall be made to him, in manner above ſpecified, before the ſaid warning.</p>
               <p>And His <hi>Majeſty</hi> having granted ſo much favour, benefit and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Debitors, as the like cannot be ſhown to have been granted at any time in this Kingdom, doth Declare, Statute and Ordain, That the Laws and Practick of the Kingdom concerning Debts, and paiment thereof, and diligence and execution for the ſame, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning proper Wodſets, where the Creditor-wodſetter hath the hazard of Fruits, Tennents, War and others, ſhall be obſerved inviolably, and be of full force, vigor and effect in all time coming, excepting ſo far as the ſame is altered, innovat and repealed by this preſent Act.</p>
